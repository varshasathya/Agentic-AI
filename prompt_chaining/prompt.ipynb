      "\n",
      "2. **AI Adoption**: The adoption of AI among mid-to-large retailers rose significantly from 27% to 41%. The most common applications of AI include search and personalization (63%), demand forecasting (52%), and customer support (47%).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **E-commerce Payment Trends**: Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has become the dominant payment method for e-commerce, accounting for 64% of transactions, with the average order value (AOV) rising to ₹1,420, representing a 6% YoY increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logistics Improvements**: There was a notable enhancement in logistics, with same-day and next-day delivery coverage increasing from 22% to 35% of pin codes. Cost reductions in last-mile delivery were achieved through route optimization, leading to an 8-10% decrease in related costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Category Performance**: The report highlights strong growth in several product categories: beauty and personal care (+26%), electronics (+14%), and fashion (+9%), with groceries also performing well at a GMV growth of 21%, particularly driven by subscription baskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Customer Experience Metrics**: The returns rate remained stable at 6.7%, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) improved by 5 points in scenarios where AI support and proactive estimated delivery times were implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regulatory Environment**: The market continues to see a strong focus on data protection and consented personalization practices. Additionally, challenges from ad-tech signal losses have prompted a shift towards first-party data strategies.\n",
